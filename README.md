# Mediawiki-stubs

Mediawiki stubs with function and class signatures from Mediawiki Core, useful for completion, code inspection, type inference, doc popups, etc.

### Disclaimer
I'm not very familiar with PHPStan or with `nikic/php-parser`, so the resulting stubs most certainly leave a lot of room for improvement.
And I have not yet succeeded in getting the stubs to load / parse correctly in VSCode, all of the Mediawiki classes / methods / functions
in my project are still underlined in red. Any contributions to get this to work with intelephense in VSCode are more than welcome.
